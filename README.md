# openAPI and Azure DevOps

This repository contains ARM-templates to create an API Management instance, and an API for the instance, as well as instructions on how to setup Azure DevOps to "build" and release the ARM templates to Azure API Management.

The first tutorial goes through how to create a pipeline that builds and deploys an API Management instance. This tutorial is found <a href="https://github.com/pelithne/openAPI-and-azdo/blob/master/create-APIM.md">here</a>.

The second tutorial builds on the first and goes through how to create a simple, Swagger based, API for that API Management instance. This tutorial can also be used as "stand-alone" if you already have an API management, and just want to deploy an API into that instance. 

The second tutorial can be found <a href="https://github.com/pelithne/openAPI-and-azdo/blob/master/create-API.md">here</a>
